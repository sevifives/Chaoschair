# WTF?

This thing takes a collection of files (sampleData), parses them into ES, then provides a simple ui/api on top to allow searching across users/tickets/organizations while also linking all the data properly

## Tech choices
* Spring Boot - familiar with what I was doing
* ES - 1) I'd never used it "pure" and 2) I didn't want to build indexes/joins in a relational db
